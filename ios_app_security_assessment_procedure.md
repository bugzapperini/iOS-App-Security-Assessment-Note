### Disable ASLR 
PIE Flag is Position Independent Enable. The binary file with PIE flag will cause ASLR in runtime.  

ASLR â€“ Address Space Layout Randomization is an important exploit mitigation technique introduced in iOS 4.3. ASLR makes the remote exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities significantly more difficult by randomizing the application objects location in the memory. By default iOS applications uses limited ASLR and only randomizes part of the objects in the memory. The image compares the different memory sections for partial and full ASLR applications.  
#### Check PIE Flag
	otool -hv theIosApp
	theIosApp:
	Mach header
      magic      cputype   cpusubtype  caps    filetype  ncmds  sizeofcmds      flags

#### Remove PIE Flag
